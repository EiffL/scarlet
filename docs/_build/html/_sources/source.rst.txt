Sources
=======

.. _scarlet.source:

`scarlet.source`_ provides classes for creating :class:`~scarlet.source.Source` objects, which represent models for individual astrophysical sources.
Typically a new source class inherits from the base :class:`~scarlet.source.Source` class with a specific set of constraints (see :class:`~scarlet.constraint.Constraint`) and an initialization function.
For example, and :class:`~scarlet.source.ExtendedSource` is a :class:`Source` initialized to be monotonic and symmetric,
although an alternative :class:`~scarlet.constraints.Constraint` can be specified.
