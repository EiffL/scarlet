Introduction
------------

`scarlet.source`_ provides classes for creating :class:`~scarlet.source.Source` objects,
which represent models for individual astrophysical sources.
A :class:`~scarlet.source.Source` is a source in a blend which is usually a single component
(a morphology and a single SED) but can also be made up of multiple components, each with it's
own SED and morphology.



Typically a new source class inherits from the base :class:`~scarlet.source.Source` class
with a specific set of constraints (see :class:`~scarlet.constraint.Constraint`)
and an initialization function.
For example, and :class:`~scarlet.source.ExtendedSource` is a :class:`Source`
initialized to be monotonic and symmetric,
although an alternative :class:`~scarlet.constraints.Constraint` can be specified.
